# CS673F19project: Computer Science Project Portal
The Computer Science Project Portal provides a scalable, integrated platform for project development and publication. Projects in different stages of development can share progress and seek input from other experts in their field. Every project submitted will be open source and searchable via keyword tagging manually from user submission and from keyword extraction in the project description.

## Technology Used
This project will be a web based full stack application. Hosted currently at this domain:
http://computerscienceprojectportal.com/

Our front end is written primarily in C# and connects to our backend via (what do we use for backend?). Users can upload new projects that will be validated and stored in our database for other users to search via key words and authors.  

## Main Features
Project Features can be broken down into 2 major groups.
1) Users actively developing and publishing new projects:
Active projects can post preliminary results while opening discussions to address issues or ask experts for their opinions as the project progresses. Once projects are later in their development cycle they can utilize our platform to distribute results on a larger scale. Additionally they can seek collaborators for future work as new potential use cases and applications for the project emerge. Additionally, for more entry level coding projects, professors can use the Project Portal to consolidate and assess final projects/assignments in their courses.
2) Users interested in discovering existing projects and via the Portal's search functionality:
Here users can search through all of our hosted projects to find the work thats relevant to their use case. This will leverage our manual and parsed keyword tagging to enable user search to work seamlessly regardless of the number of projects hosted on our site. Additionally users may be able to open issues and contact the project author in the future.

## Installation or Deployment
Since this is a web based application there is no installation necessary (outside of a web browser). Just visit our link!
